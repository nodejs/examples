# Node.js Examples: CLI

In this directory, we have examples of Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) built with Node.js. See the [Examples section](../README.md#examples) of the root [README.md](../README.md) for a list of all projects contained within, or take a look through the directories yourself.

## What is a CLI in the context of nodejs/examples
