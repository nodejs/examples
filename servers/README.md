# Node.js Examples: Servers

In this directory, we have examples of servers that are built with Node.js. See the [Examples section](../README.md#examples) of the root [README.md](../README.md) for a list of all projects contained within, or take a look through the directories yourself.

## What is a Server in the context of nodejs/examples

Any software built with Node.js that serves content over HTTP. For example:

- An API server that responds with a JSON payload
- A web server that serves dynamic content based on user requests
